* About
A variety of tools for helping with manuscript production in LaTex
environment. Initially this started with plotting, now I am trying to
consolidate all of the tools into one central package.

* Plotting
[[http://matplotlib.org/][matplotlib]] is a wonderful tool for scientific plotting in
python. However, it does require some tweaking if you want to generate
publication quality plots with it. The [[file:plots.py][plots]] file is an initial
example of how to set some of these parameters for a given document.

Here are some of the resources I used for putting this together.
